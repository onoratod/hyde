# About

My name is **Donato Onorato**, I'm a senior at the [University of Pennsylvania](http://www.upenn.edu) studying Mathematical Economics. Currently, I work as a research assistant for [Prof. Hanming Fang](https://economics.sas.upenn.edu/faculty/hanming-fang) and [Prof. Pinar Yildirim](https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/pyild/), where I help them with their research projects concerning the impact of automation on the composition of the job market as well as their work trying to understand the evolution of skills in the job market.

Soon after graduation I hope to pursue my PhD in Economics and then conduct my own research at an international organization such as the [IMF](http://imf.org), [World Bank](http://www.worldbank.org), or [OECD](http://www.oecd.org) or a central bank like the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov). My research interests within economics broadly center around international finance, central banking, and macroeconomics.

In my free time I enjoy cooking and exploring Philadelphia for new restaurants. The most recent place I tried out was [Sampan](http://www.sampanphilly.com). I also enjoy reading about tech and learning how to code (albeit at a relatively basic level). Currently, I'm creating this website using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and trying to learn more about [Python](https://www.python.org) for my research.
