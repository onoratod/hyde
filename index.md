My name is **Donato Onorato**, I'm currently a research assistant at MIT. Next fall I'll be starting my PhD in Economics at Columbia University. Previously, I worked as a pre-doctoral fellow at [Opportunity Insights](https://opportunityinsights.org/), working with Census micro data on topics related to intergenerational mobility. In my free time I enjoy cooking and exploring new restaurants.
