[Sampan](http://www.sampanphilly.com/#sampan) is an Asian-fusion small-plate (think tapas) restuarant in Philly's Midtown Village from [Chef Michael Schulson](https://michaelschulson.com).

The restuarant uses an **open kitchen** concept meaning that your dishes are served to you as soon as they come out of the kitchen rather than holding them and bringing them out in some select order. The restuarant also has a bar which offers an eclectic collection of cocktails, wine, beer, and of course sake.

On my visit, I had the Edamame Dumplings, which were absolutely delightful. Wrapped in a lovely steamed blanket and filled with a great edemame, truffle, and sake mix.

They were a great way to start off the meal. Next came the King Oyster Mushrooms, albeit disappointingly small, they more than made up for it with their outstanding flavor. They came skewered, straight off the grill, smoky and covered in a Yakitori glaze.


On the side, we enjoyed the roasted broccoli, which are sauted in a light white soy sauce and pleasantly refreshing.
